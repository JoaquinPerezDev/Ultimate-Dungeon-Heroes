# Ultimate-Dungeon-Heroes
Ultimate Dungeon Heroes is a deck-building card game that gives the player a chance to become the UDH! 

For my first project, I wanted to focus on OOP classes, inheritance, methods, as well as event listeners, functions, conditionals and loops. 

The goal is to make a "Slay the Spire" clone, starting with 1 character class, 5 levels and a basic deck of attack and block cards. Once functionality is in place and debugging is successful, I can begin to include/add more features to enrich user experience and create more complexity in game states. 

I first need to figure out how to create a deck, shuffle it, allow the player to choose cards to use on the enemies, then have the player become the ULTIMATE DUNGEON HERO!
